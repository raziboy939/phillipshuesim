# Phillips Hue Simulation instructions

A simple node application to simulate a Phillips Hue Lamp API environment.  
As per task instructions the app prints initial configuration of lamps, and any changes made to those lamps.





Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed and that the hardware (or simulator) is 
running on http://localhost:8080/.

cd phillipshuesim
npm install
node main.js
```

The app should now be running and reciving data from localhost:8080.
